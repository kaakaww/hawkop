description: Add a new StackHawk API integration
---

Help me add a new StackHawk API endpoint integration. Ask me:
1. What API endpoint should be integrated?
2. What HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)?
3. What request/response structures are needed?
4. Should this support pagination?

Then implement the API client method following the existing patterns in src/client/stackhawk.rs with proper error handling, rate limiting, and JWT authentication.
