description: Add a new CLI command to HawkOp
---

Help me add a new command to the HawkOp CLI. Ask me:
1. What command name should be added?
2. What subcommands (if any) should it have?
3. What arguments/flags does it need?
4. What should the command do?

Then implement the command following the existing patterns in src/cli/ and integrate it into the main CLI app.
