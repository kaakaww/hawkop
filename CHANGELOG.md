## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- **Full team management commands** - First CRUD implementation in HawkOp
  - `team get <TEAM>` - View team details with members and applications
  - `team create <NAME>` - Create a new team with optional `--users` and `--apps`
  - `team rename <TEAM> --name <NEW>` - Rename an existing team
  - `team delete <TEAM>` - Delete a team (with confirmation prompt)
- **Team member management** for SCIM-style automation
  - `team add-user <TEAM> <USER>...` - Add users to a team
  - `team remove-user <TEAM> <USER>...` - Remove users from a team
  - `team set-users <TEAM> <USER>...` - Replace all team members (IdP sync)
- **Team application assignment**
  - `team add-app <TEAM> <APP>...` - Assign applications to a team
  - `team remove-app <TEAM> <APP>...` - Unassign applications from a team
  - `team set-apps <TEAM> <APP>...` - Replace all app assignments
- **Flexible identifier resolution** - All team commands accept names OR UUIDs
  - Teams: by name or team UUID
  - Users: by email or user UUID
  - Apps: by name or application UUID
- **Dry-run mode** (`--dry-run`) on all mutating team commands
- **Stdin support** (`--stdin`) for bulk operations in scripts
- **Team list filters** - `--name`, `--member`, `--app` for filtering teams
- **Shell completions** for team names, user emails, and app names
- **Duplicate detection** - Prevents creating teams with duplicate names
- **API documentation** for StackHawk API quirks and edge cases (`api-quirks.md`)

### Changed

- **Cache safety** - Fresh reads before mutations, cache invalidation after changes
- **Navigation hints** - Standardized to use `→` arrow across all commands
- Team data cached with 1-minute TTL for responsive completions

### Fixed

- Include `organizationId` in team update requests (API requires all 5 fields despite OpenAPI spec)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Dynamic shell completions** for scan IDs, app names, plugin IDs, and URI IDs
  - Completions query StackHawk API in real-time when you press TAB
  - Rich metadata shown in completion hints (app, env, status, date)
  - Context-aware: plugin completions show severity, URI completions show method/path
  - Supports bash, zsh, and fish via `source <(COMPLETE=<shell> hawkop)`
- **SQLite caching** for API responses and completions
  - Configurable TTLs per endpoint type
  - Automatic cache invalidation and schema versioning
  - Blob storage for large responses (>10KB)
- **Exponential backoff** for rate limit retries with jitter
- **`hawkop scan get`** command for detailed scan exploration
  - Rich pretty format with color-coded severity
  - User and policy name lookup
  - `--plugin-id` and `--uri-id` filters for drill-down
- Test fixture builders for easy test data creation
- Enhanced `MockStackHawkClient` with configurable simulation capabilities
- Integration tests for CLI error scenarios

### Changed

- **Major codebase refactoring** for improved maintainability:
  - Split `client/mod.rs` into `client/api/` and `client/models/` sub-modules
  - Split `models/display.rs` (1900 lines) into domain-specific modules
  - Extracted CLI args into `cli/args/` module (common, pagination, filters)
  - Added generic list command handler to reduce duplication
- Moved SQLite cache I/O to blocking thread pool for better async performance
- Reduced default scan list limit from 25 to 10 for faster response
- Restructured documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, PLANNING) for clarity

### Fixed

- Deduplicate tags in scan output
- Filter unexpanded environment variables from scan metadata

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- `hawkop scan view` command for drill-down exploration of scan results
  - `scan view <id>` - scan overview with findings summary
  - `scan view <id> alerts` - list all alerts (plugins)
  - `scan view <id> alert <plugin>` - alert detail with affected paths
  - `scan view <id> alert <plugin> uri <uri-id>` - URI detail with evidence
  - `scan view <id> alert <plugin> uri <uri-id> message` - HTTP request/response with curl command
- Scan context banner showing app/environment, host, HawkScan version, date, and duration
- Timezone abbreviation mapping for common zones (MST, EST, PST, etc.)

### Changed

- Table output now uses clean minimal style (vertical separators, header underline only)
- Navigation hints guide users through drill-down exploration

## [0.2.2] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- `hawkop audit list` command with filtering by activity type, user, email, and date ranges
- `hawkop oas list` command to list hosted OpenAPI specifications

- `hawkop secret list` command to list user secret names
- `hawkop completion` command for shell completions (bash, zsh, fish, powershell)
- `--type` filter for `hawkop app list` to filter by cloud/standard applications
- Comprehensive unit tests for error types, display models, and output formatters

### Changed

- Refactored date parsing to use let-chains for cleaner conditionals
